# LandingScreen
A simple landing screen built with React Native, React Native Reanimated and Lottie animations.

To run the project simply create a directory on your machine and run this line of command in it
```
git clone https://github.com/jellyCodee/LandingScreen.git
```

Or you can just download the project zip file if you prefer that approach.


Here is a sample of what the animation looks like. Nothing fancy because it was lazy work üôÇ
